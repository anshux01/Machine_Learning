## 1. Business Understanding
**Problem:** Airlines face challenges in terminal allocation and operations, causing inefficiencies and passenger dissatisfaction.  
**Objective:** Maximize operational efficiency and financial health using clustering-based segmentation.  
**Constraints:** Maintain passenger experience while increasing efficiency.  

**Success Criteria:**  
- **Business:** Improve operational efficiency by 10â€“12%  
- **ML:** Silhouette Score â‰¥ 0.7  
- **Economic:** Hypothetical revenue growth by â‰¥ 8%

## 2. Data Understanding
**Source:** AirTraffic_Passenger_Statistics.csv  
**Shape:** 15,007 rows Ã— 9 columns  
**Observations:**  
- Null values in airline IATA codes  
- Skewed passenger count distribution  
- Seasonal peaks (July, August, December)  
- Growth until 2015; dip in 2016 (data issue)

## 3. Data Preparation
- Removed duplicates and null handling  
- Feature Engineering: Month â†’ numeric + cyclical (sin/cos)  
- Winsorization for outliers  
- One-Hot Encoding for categorical data  
- StandardScaler for normalization  

---

## 4. Modeling
- Technique: Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative)  
- Metrics: Euclidean Distance, Ward/Complete Linkage  
- Optimal Clusters: 5 (based on dendrogram + silhouette score)  

---

## 5. Evaluation
- **Silhouette Score â‰¥ 0.7** achieved  
- Business Insights:  
  - United Airlines leads market share  
  - Strong seasonality in demand  
  - Unequal terminal distribution  

---

## 6. Deployment (Future Scope)
- Store clustered data in MySQL for BI dashboards  
- Develop **interactive dashboards** (Power BI / Streamlit)  
- Automate pipeline for monthly retraining  

---

## 7. Monitoring & Maintenance
- Monitor silhouette score monthly  
- Refresh clusters with new passenger data  
- Trigger retraining if silhouette score drops < 0.7  

---

## Deliverables
- Notebook: Hierarchical_Clustering.ipynb  
- Report: Assignement_3.html  
- Project Charter: Project_Charter.md  
- GitHub Repo: With README, requirements.txt, LICENSE
